Non-Production Environment								Production Environment

DEV,QA,UAT,Pre-Prod/Staging 			<==>			PROD - Environment


Using DevOps We are actually gng to automate these process.

DEV Environment Create the the source code, Java Application ===>
Build ===>> is a process of compiling the source code and creating the artifacts(binaries)*.war
Java Application ===>

The same artifacts will be promoted to higher envi. (QA/UAT/Pre-Prod/Staging) PROD.

Continous Deployment ::: 
Continous Integration ::: ===>> Build ===>> is a process of compiling the source code and creating the artifacts(binaries)*.war

Continous Delivery :::  Automatically deploy the artifacts in all the (DEV,QA,UAT,Pre-Prod/Staging) 
						but, to deploy to a prod envi you need Manual approval process.

Continuous Deployment ::: Automatically deploy the artifacts in all the (DEV,QA,UAT,Pre-Prod/Staging)  and also in Production.


DevOps Strategies you define!!!!  Continous Improvement.......
